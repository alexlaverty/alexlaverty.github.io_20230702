<h2 id="what-is-the-difference-between-ssh-rsa-and-ssh-ed25519">What is the difference between “ssh-rsa” and “ssh-ed25519”</h2>

<p>“ssh-rsa” and “ssh-ed25519” are two different algorithms used in SSH public key cryptography.</p>

<p>The “ssh-rsa” algorithm is one of the earliest public key cryptography algorithms used in SSH and is based on the RSA algorithm. It provides a secure method of authentication and encryption, but has some limitations in terms of speed and key size.</p>

<p>On the other hand, “ssh-ed25519” is a more recent addition to SSH and is based on the Edwards-curve Digital Signature Algorithm (EdDSA). It is considered to be more secure than “ssh-rsa” due to its smaller key size and the use of elliptic curve cryptography. It is also faster and provides better resistance against side-channel attacks.</p>

<p>In general, “ssh-ed25519” is the recommended choice for new deployments, as it offers improved security and performance compared to “ssh-rsa”. However, “ssh-rsa” is still widely used and supported, and may be required in certain legacy systems or compatibility scenarios.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-the-difference-between-known_hosts-and-authorized_keys-">what is the difference between known_hosts and authorized_keys ?</h2>

<p>known_hosts and authorized_keys are files used by the SSH (Secure Shell) protocol.</p>

<p>known_hosts file contains the host keys of remote servers that the client has previously connected to and the client can use this file to verify the authenticity of the server.</p>

<p>authorized_keys file, on the other hand, contains the public keys of clients that are authorized to access the server. When a client tries to connect to the server, the server will check the client’s public key against the keys listed in the authorized_keys file to determine whether the client is allowed to access the server or not.</p>

<p>In summary, known_hosts is used for server authentication by the client, while authorized_keys is used for client authentication by the server.</p>
