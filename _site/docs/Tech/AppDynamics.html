<h2 id="what-is-the-difference-between-the-appdynamics-machine-agent-and-app-agent">What is the difference between the AppDynamics machine agent and app agent?</h2>

<p>AppDynamics is a comprehensive application performance management (APM) tool that helps organizations monitor and optimize their applications for optimal performance. The AppDynamics platform includes a variety of agents that can be used to monitor different aspects of application performance, including the machine agent and the app agent.</p>

<p>The machine agent is a component of the AppDynamics platform that is used to monitor the infrastructure on which the application is running. This agent provides visibility into server and operating system metrics, such as CPU usage, memory usage, disk usage, and network utilization. The machine agent is typically deployed on the same server as the application.</p>

<p>The app agent, on the other hand, is used to monitor the performance of the application code itself. This agent provides visibility into the performance of the application’s individual transactions, as well as the performance of the application’s individual components, such as servlets, controllers, and database queries. The app agent is typically deployed as a Java agent, .NET agent, or other language-specific agent, and is used to instrument the application code.</p>

<p>In summary, while both the machine agent and the app agent are important components of the AppDynamics platform, they are used to monitor different aspects of application performance. The machine agent provides visibility into the underlying infrastructure, while the app agent provides visibility into the performance of the application code itself.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-dmm-mode-in-appdynamics">what is DMM mode in appdynamics?</h2>

<p>DMM (Dynamic Monitoring Mode) is a mode in AppDynamics that allows you to dynamically adjust the level of monitoring for your application in real-time based on the workload and traffic to the application.</p>

<p>In DMM, AppDynamics can automatically adjust the frequency of data collection, sampling, and other monitoring settings based on the traffic patterns of the application. This can help reduce the overhead of monitoring on your application and ensure that you are collecting the right level of data to diagnose issues and optimize performance.</p>

<p>DMM allows you to specify different monitoring settings for different parts of your application, such as specific business transactions or tiers, based on their importance and impact on the overall performance of the application. You can configure DMM using the AppDynamics Controller, which provides a graphical interface for specifying the monitoring levels and thresholds for each part of your application.</p>

<p>In addition to reducing overhead and improving the accuracy of monitoring, DMM can also help you optimize the performance of your application by identifying areas where additional monitoring or tuning may be needed. By providing real-time feedback on the impact of changes to the application, DMM can help you make informed decisions about how to optimize your application for better performance and user experience.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-set-appdynamics-agent-to-diagnostic-mode-in-the-controll-xml-config-file">How to set appdynamics agent to diagnostic mode in the controll xml config file</h2>

<p>To set the DDM (Dynamic Debug Mode) to diagnostic level in the control.xml configuration file, you can add the following element:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&lt;agent-config&gt;
  &lt;property name="debug.dynamicDebug.enabled" value="true"/&gt;
  &lt;property name="debug.dynamicDebug.level" value="diagnostic"/&gt;
&lt;/agent-config&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This configuration enables dynamic debug mode and sets the debug level to “diagnostic”, which provides the highest level of detail for diagnostic information.</p>

<p>You can add this element to the control.xml file in the “controller-info” directory of your AppDynamics agent installation. Once you have added the element and saved the file, you will need to restart the agent for the changes to take effect.</p>

<p>When dynamic debug mode is enabled, the AppDynamics agent will generate additional logging and diagnostic information, which can be used to troubleshoot issues and optimize the performance of your application. The diagnostic information is written to log files in the agent’s “logs” directory, which can be viewed and analyzed using the AppDynamics diagnostic tool or other log analysis tools.</p>

<h2 id="do-i-need-to-restart-the-agent-for-the-ddm-mode-setting-to-take-effect">Do I need to restart the agent for the DDM mode setting to take effect?</h2>

<p>Yes, you will need to restart the AppDynamics agent for the DDM (Dynamic Debug Mode) mode setting to take effect.</p>

<p>When you modify the DDM settings in the agent configuration file, the changes will not be applied until the agent is restarted. This is because the AppDynamics agent reads the configuration file at startup and uses the settings to determine how to monitor the application.</p>

<p>To restart the AppDynamics agent, you can use the appropriate method for your system, such as restarting the service or process that runs the agent. Once the agent is restarted, it will read the updated configuration file and apply the new DDM settings, including any changes you made to the debug level or other parameters.</p>

<p>It’s important to note that enabling DDM can increase the overhead of monitoring on your application, as it generates additional logging and diagnostic information. Therefore, it’s generally recommended to use DDM only for short periods of time when troubleshooting specific issues, and to disable it once the issue has been resolved.</p>
