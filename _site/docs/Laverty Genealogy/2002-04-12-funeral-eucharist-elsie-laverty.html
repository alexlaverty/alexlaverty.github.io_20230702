<p>Firs</p>

<p>Come as you are, that’s how I want you Come as you are, feel quite at home.</p>

<p>Close to my heart loved and forgiven</p>

<p>Come as you are why stand alone?</p>

<p>No need to fear love sets no limits</p>

<p>Don’t run away shame and disheartened</p>

<p>No need to fear love never ends. Rest in my love trust me again.</p>

<p>I came to call sinners not just the virtuous I came to bring peace not to condemn Each time you fail to live by my promise Why do you think I’d love you the less?</p>

<p>Come as you are that’s how I love you; Come as you are, trust me again</p>

<p>Nothing can change the love that I bear you, All will be well, just come as you are.</p>

<p>Creator God, you are the loving one who gave Elsie life by breathing into her your own divine breath. You are the all wise one who has now called her from among us.</p>

<p>We ask that in your wisdom and compassion you keep vigil with us as we learn to let go of this one whom we have greatly loved. May this time of tears and grieving be tempered by our story telling and mutual support. so that as we become strong together we may be ready to return our sister to you, our loving God.</p>

<p>We stand here with Jesus, the one who has shown us the true meaning of death. With him and in his Holy Spirit we place ourselves in your hands, now and forever. Amen.</p>

<h2 id="graveside-prayer">GRAVESIDE PRAYER</h2>

<p>We bring the body of our sister Elsie Pearl Laverty to return it to the earth from which it was formed by our loving Creator. It is fitting that we do so, since it is this mother earth which gave her body shape and colour and strength.</p>

<p>We know that this is a worthy resting place. With reverence we touch this earth and bless our sister’s body.</p>

<p>+</p>

<h2 id="when-the-casket-is-placed-at-the-grave">WHEN THE CASKET IS PLACED AT THE GRAVE</h2>

<p>Whilst we entrust this body of flesh to the earth from whence it came we remember the earth’s faithful promise of spring - that from her dark and mysterious richness new and surprising growth abound.</p>

<p>This promise has been made clear for us in the resurrection of Jesus Christ, who, like Elsie, died and was laid in the earth. We believe, that like Jesus, our sister will come to new life in that same Jesus Christ. While we leave this holy place behind we carry with us the living spirit of Elsie and all those holy men and women who have gone before us and who now live a new and glorious life.</p>

<p>Commending their remains to this earth we commend their spirit to all who have loved and now remember them…..</p>

<h2 id="concluding-prayer">CONCLUDING PRAYER</h2>

<p>Loving and merciful God hear the prayers we offer for our sister Elsie. By her faith and hope she has always been united with you, her Creator. By her generous nature she has been a loving disciple of Jesus Christ. In her strong and enabling love she has lived in your Holy Spirit.</p>

<p>Receive her now into the fulness of your presence. Give comfort to all of us who mourn her passing from our midst. For we believe that you will raise us all on the last day.</p>

<p>The Laverty Family thank you for your presence here today. We appreciate your prayers, support and friendship, and invite you to refreshments after this celebration at</p>

<p>Grafton City Services Bowling Club, Kemp Street (Opposite the family home).</p>
