<p>Regular readers of the Mid-Coast Observer may remember a number of articles on two photographs taken during World War One of brothers Patrick and John McGree.</p>

<p>The search for identity of the brothers led two men - Michael Long from England and Melbourneâ€™s David Sandground - on a world-wide search, eventually ending in the small farming village of Taylors Arm.</p>

<p>Two stories were run in this paper, asking anyone who knew the identity of the young men to come forward. And it worked.</p>

<p>The two men received numerous calls from people who were related to, or knew of the McGree boys. Taylors Arm Sub-Branch members also offered their assistance.</p>

<p>And on October 3, the photographs will take their rightful place during an official presentation to be held at noon.</p>

<p>Taylors Arm Sub-Branch members are now completing arrangements for Mr Sandground to hand over these unique pieces of wartime history to members of the McGree family.</p>

<p>The presentation will coincide with another special event in Taylors Arm history - the unveiling and dedication of a plaque to those who gave their lives to our country.</p>

<p>All relatives, friends and interested people are invited to attend this histor ical event. Organisers expect a large attendance of neighbouring sub branch members to witness the occa sion.</p>
