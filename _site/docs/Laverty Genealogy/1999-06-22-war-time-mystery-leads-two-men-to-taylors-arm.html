<p>War-time mystery leads two men to Taylors Arm</p>

<p>A year-long mystery of mistaken names, hours of research and miles of travelling has finally led two men- one from Melbourne and one from London - to a possible solution in the small country village of Taylors Arm.</p>

<p>David Sandground and Michael Long took possession of some valuable pieces of photographic wartime histo- ry in 1998 and have spent almost two years since trying to find the pho- tographs’ rightful owner.</p>

<p>Michael, an archivist and former teacher at London’s Kingsbury High School, was given the photos during a trip to Northern France.</p>

<p>After one wrong name and countless phone calls and e-mails, the pair has finally identified the faces in their pho tographs: brothers Patrick and John McGree, both killed during World War One.</p>

<p>David and Michael are now trying to track a Mr and Mrs McGree, believed to live at Taylors Arm.</p>

<p>They are keen to get the photographs back to relatives of the brothers and would be happy to hear from anyone with information.</p>

<p>If you have any information on the McGree family, call David Sandground on (03) 9625 0354.</p>
