<h2 id="eulogy">EULOGY</h2>

<p>Today as we remember and give thanks for the life of our mother, it is impossible to remember her without mentioning our father also.</p>

<p>Throughout the 54 years of their married life, they were totally committed to each other and their children -they prayed together every night of those 54 years.</p>

<p>This was a tremendous source of grace to them- and to each of their 11 children.</p>

<p>Since the death of my father-four years ago-my mother experienced her own personal brokenness, from which she never really fully recovered.</p>

<p>Like Mary, the mother of Jesus, my mother was a gentle woman of Taith, one who pondered many things in her heart..</p>

<p>In a group, she was generally quiet, reserved and discreet in her conversations.</p>

<p>“She was gifted with tremendous goodness and generosity.She played an important role in the ministry at 211 Dobie St. where for the last eight years she cooked many wonderful cakes, pies and biscuits for the inmates at the correctional centre and their families when they came to visit .On Tuesday, as I thanked her for all she had done, she responded by saying, “I loved doing it”…</p>

<p>Her greatest love was for her family.</p>

<p>Her husband, children, grandchildren and greatgrand children</p>

<p>meant everything to her.</p>

<p>She has left behind her, 11 unfinished masterpieces in her children and I’m sure she would envisage that her children would continue the legacy she and my father instilled in us during their parenting,</p>

<p>Love is patient, love is kind. It is not jealous…It is not rude, it does not seek its own interests-It bears all things, hopes all things, endures all things… Love never fails..</p>

<p>May she rest in peace.</p>
