<p>Hundreds of descendants of the Laverty</p>

<p>family flocked back to the Nambucca Valley recently for a family reunion. It was one of the many events held in the Nambucca Valley during the October long</p>

<p>weekend.</p>

<p>The family, which has traced its roots back to landing in Australia from Ireland and England in about 1860, filled the Macksville Showground hall to overflow ing for the occasion.</p>

<p>The hall was decorated with Bambo ferns and hundreds of balloons fishing. nets. Old and new photographs adorning the walls. A photograph of the first house built at</p>

<p>Taylors Arm- by a Laverty-took pride of place on the stage. About 1000 Lavertys (including their wives and husbands) took part in the reunion, including one family group with 200 descendants.</p>

<p>They danced into the small hours to the music of Phillip Laverty and Gavin Kings’ “True Blue” band.</p>

<p>The dancing finished at lam, and some were back at 6.30am to decorate the truck for Open Air Mass on Sunday morning.</p>
