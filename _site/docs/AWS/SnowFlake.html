<h2 id="what-is-a-columnar-format">What is a columnar format?</h2>

<p>A columnar format is a method of organizing data in a database or data warehouse in which data is stored in columns, rather than in rows as in traditional relational databases. In a columnar format, each column contains the values of a specific attribute or field, such as name, address, or date, across all records in the table.</p>

<p>Columnar storage is different from row-based storage, where data is stored in rows and each row represents a complete record. In a row-based storage, data for all attributes of a record is stored together in a single row.</p>

<p>The advantage of columnar storage is that it enables more efficient data compression, as similar data values can be grouped and compressed together in a column. Additionally, since a columnar format only reads the required columns for a query, it can result in faster query execution times compared to row-based storage. This makes columnar storage well-suited for large data warehousing and analytical workloads where queries often access a small subset of columns in a table.</p>
