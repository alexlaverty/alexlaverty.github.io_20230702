<p>We were woken up last night at about 1:30 AM by a police helicopter, it was circling around and hovering quite low.</p>

<p>Apparently at the end of the street people hand claimed that a car had driven off the cliff.</p>

<p>This morning there were helicopters and police boats around the area looking for the car.</p>

<p>There was fairly large swell today and during the afternoon one of the police boats had become beached on the rocks.</p>

<p>A crowd gathered and news crews arrived to film the event.</p>

<p>Where the car had driven off the cliff there were large waves breaking on the rocks making it difficult for the police divers.
Apparently one of the boats had a power issue and needed to be towed, the tow rope snapped and the boat became stuck on the rocks.</p>

<p>The police had prevented people from getting close to see the boat so people dangerously climbed along the cliffs to have a look and take selfies</p>
