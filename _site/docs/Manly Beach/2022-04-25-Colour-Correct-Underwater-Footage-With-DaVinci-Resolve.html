<p>A while ago I went camping with my family to Narrabeen Caravan Park, while there I took some underwater video of various sea creatures with my Sony Action camera.</p>

<p>The original video I captured didnâ€™t look that great, but I was able to fix it up using video editing software called DaVinci Resolve.</p>

<p>This video will demonstrate how I colour corrected the underwater footage with a couple of example clips :</p>

<p>you can download the sample underwater video clips if you want to practice doing colour correction from here :</p>
