<h2 id="what-does-franked-vs-non-franked-dividend-mean">What does franked vs non-franked dividend mean?</h2>

<p>Franked and non-franked dividends are terms used to describe the tax treatment of dividends paid by a company to its shareholders.</p>

<p>A franked dividend is a dividend that has already had the company’s corporate tax paid on it. When a company earns profits, it pays corporate tax on those profits. If the company decides to distribute some of those profits as dividends to its shareholders, it can “frank” the dividend by attaching a franking credit to it, which represents the tax already paid on the profits.</p>

<p>When a shareholder receives a franked dividend, they are entitled to a credit for the tax already paid by the company. This credit is known as a franking credit or imputation credit. The shareholder can use the franking credit to offset their own tax liability. If the shareholder’s tax liability is lower than the amount of franking credits, they can receive a cash refund from the government for the difference.</p>

<p>On the other hand, a non-franked dividend is a dividend that has not had the company’s corporate tax paid on it. Non-franked dividends are also known as unfranked dividends. When a shareholder receives a non-franked dividend, they are not entitled to a franking credit, and the dividend is taxed as ordinary income at the shareholder’s marginal tax rate.</p>

<p>In summary, franked dividends are more tax-efficient for shareholders because they have already had the company’s corporate tax paid on them, and the shareholder can use franking credits to offset their own tax liability. Non-franked dividends, on the other hand, are taxed as ordinary income and do not come with franking credits.</p>
