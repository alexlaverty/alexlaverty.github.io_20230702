<p>The community living next to a beautiful ocean with a focus on technology and sustainable living would be an exciting and innovative place to live. Letâ€™s dive into the different aspects of this community and see what makes it so special.</p>

<p>First and foremost, the location of the community would be an ideal spot for ocean lovers. The community would be situated right next to the ocean, allowing residents to indulge in activities such as diving for seafood and surfing for exercise. The abundance of fresh seafood would make for delicious and healthy meals, and the surfing would provide a fun way to stay active and enjoy the beautiful natural surroundings.</p>

<p>In addition to the ocean-based activities, the community would also have a strong focus on technology and sustainability. One example of this would be a computer-automated hydroponic vegetable growing system. Hydroponics is a method of growing plants without soil, instead using nutrient-rich water to nourish the plants. A computer system would control the amount of water and nutrients provided to the plants, ensuring optimal growth and harvest. This would not only provide fresh, healthy produce for the community, but also reduce the environmental impact of traditional agriculture.</p>

<p>The community would also incorporate green energy into its infrastructure. Solar panels and wind turbines would be used to power the homes and other buildings in the community, reducing reliance on non-renewable energy sources. The community would also be designed with energy efficiency in mind, using materials and techniques to reduce energy consumption and waste.</p>

<p>In terms of housing, the community would utilize 3D printing technology to construct mass-produced homes. The 3D printer would run on rail tracks and use a mix of cement and local soils to build the walls. This would allow for quick and efficient construction, reducing the cost and time required to build homes. Additionally, using local materials would reduce transportation costs and environmental impact.</p>

<p>Overall, the community described would be a unique and exciting place to live, combining the beauty of the ocean with the innovation of technology and sustainability. Residents would be able to enjoy fresh seafood and surfing, while also benefiting from the latest in green energy and 3D printing technology. It would be a model for future communities, showing how we can live in harmony with nature while also utilizing the latest in technology and innovation.</p>
