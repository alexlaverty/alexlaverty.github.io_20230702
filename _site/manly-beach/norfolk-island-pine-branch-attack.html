<p>I was initialy in shock and staggered away for a bit and then fell to the ground, a number of people came over to help, one of the ladies was a nurse and was helping me.</p>

<p>After a couple of minutes I was over the intial shock, I checked my arm and had a large graze down my arm.</p>

<p>I was unable to lift my arm on the first day, and my arm continued to hurt for the rest of the week, a bruise formed from my shoulder down to my wrist.</p>

<p>I posted the photos of my injury and the fallen branches to Manly Living Facebook group and two news agencies contacted me and wrote a story about it.</p>

<p>A Sydney man was struck by falling tree branches at a popular beach on Thursday leaving him writhing in pain on the ground.</p>

<p>Now he’s warning others to be careful saying “they might not be so lucky”.</p>

<p>Alex Laverty was casually walking the length of Manly beach with his headphones on when “a large bunch of branches” fell and hit him.</p>

<p>“I think I was in shock for a bit and felt like I couldn’t move my arm, I thought it was broken,” he told Yahoo News Australia.</p>

<p>“I was staggering around a bit and then fell to the ground and a bunch of bystanders ran over to help me”.</p>

The branches fell from the iconic Norfolk Pines, which have proven troublesome in the past. It’s believed there have been numerous reports of branches falling and narrowly missing bystanders.</p>

<p>Mr Laverty told Yahoo that he’d seen fallen branches in the area before but nothing as big as the one that struck him. The incident left a large, raw graze down the side of his arm.</p>

<p>In February, a large branch marginally missed a woman who was inside a gazebo set up under a tree, Manly Observer reported.</p>

<p>And another man was riding his bicycle along the same path when a powerful branch came crashing down.</p>

<h2 id="locals-not-surprised-an-accident-waiting-to-happen">Locals not surprised: ‘An accident waiting to happen’</h2>

<p>Following the incident, Mr Laverty shared photos on Facebook as a warning to other locals.</p>

<p>One shows his injured arm with a notable graze. Others show the large pile of tree trimmings that caused it.</p>

<p>“I got off pretty easy but I don’t want others to get hurt,” he wrote in the comments. “It’s a busy walkway and I doubt it’s the last set of branches that will come down.”</p>

<p>People were shocked but not surprised by what happened. One man said it was “an accident waiting to happen.”</p>

<p>“I’m really glad you didn’t have kids (or anyone, really) with you at the time. I would have been in shock too if this had happened to me,” he said.</p>

<p>Others said he was “lucky” the branches grazed his arm, instead of hitting his head.</p>

<h2 id="no-need-for-concern-says-council-representative">‘No need for concern,’ says council representative</h2>

<p>Earlier this month, Northern Beaches Deputy Mayor Candy Bingham admitted there was “no need for concern” when addressing the dropping branches.</p>

<p>“Norfolk’s are dropping branches all over the place at the moment,” she said – but there was a valid reason why.</p>

<p>“Advice from Council’s arborist is this is due to the softwood growth which has been promoted by the excessive amount of rain,” she wrote in a post on Facebook.</p>

<p>“There has also been some branch drop occurring due to the extra weight with cones attached. No need for concern.”</p>

<p>When contacted by Yahoo News Australia about her comments, Ms Bingham confirmed she was “referring to the health of the trees” and said injuries such as Mr Laverty’s “are concerning”.</p>

<p>“Some of these pines are over 100 years old and to my knowledge, we have not had these issues before, certainly not in recent years,” she said.</p>

<p>Mr Laverty said he hopes the Northern Beaches Council “will put up a warning sign or check the trees again”.</p>

<p>“I think Manly beach is pretty famous for its pines and it’s a part of our image so I don’t think they should be cut down,” he told Yahoo News Australia.</p>

<p>“People should be diverted onto the beach until they can ensure the trees are safe. The next person might not be so lucky,” he added.</p>

<h2 id="series-of-deaths-caused-by-falling-trees-in-australia">Series of deaths caused by falling trees in Australia.</h2>

<p>Previously, a Northern Beaches woman died with two others injured after a wild storm ripped through the area, causing trees and powerlines to come crashing down.</p>

<p>The storm damage took the life of the 70-year-old woman.</p>

<p>And in 2019, a woman was crushed to death by a century-old tree while she was jogging at an inner Melbourne park.</p>

<p>Pictures from the scene show the massive tree, which had been completely uprooted, lying on its side over a footpath.</p>

<p>A Cairns mum suffered the same fate earlier that year when a falling tree hit her car in Far North Queensland.</p>

<p>Her 26-year-old partner was taken to the hospital in a stable condition but the woman, 38-year-old Tammy Machen, died at the scene.</p>

<p>Yahoo News Australia contacted Northern Beaches Council for comment.</p>
