TLS 1.0 was introduced in 1999 as a revision of SSL 3.0, and later versions of TLS have continued to build on this.</p><p>The most notable differences between SSL and TLS include:</p><ul><li><p>Cipher Suites: TLS offers a wider range of encryption algorithms, which are known as cipher suites. This means that TLS can support stronger encryption standards than SSL.</p></li><li><p>Authentication: TLS includes improved certificate validation, which ensures that data is transmitted securely and that the client can trust the server it is communicating with.</p></li><li><p>Handshake process: TLS has a slightly different handshake process compared to SSL, which adds an extra layer of security. The handshake process is used to initiate a secure connection between the client and server.</p></li></ul><p>Overall, TLS is considered to be a more secure and efficient protocol than SSL, and it has largely replaced SSL for secure data transfers on the internet.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-is-the-purpose-of-cipher-suites">What is the purpose of Cipher Suites?<a href="#what-is-the-purpose-of-cipher-suites" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What is the purpose of Cipher Suites?" title="Direct link to What is the purpose of Cipher Suites?">​</a></h2><p>A Cipher Suite is a set of algorithms that are used to secure internet communications. It defines the protocols and algorithms used for secure communication such as encryption, message authentication, and key exchange. Cipher Suites determine the strength and security of the encryption used in a network connection. A Cipher Suite specifies the cryptographic algorithms and protocols that are used to secure communication between the client and server, such as SSL or TLS. The selection of a Cipher Suite is an important aspect of securing communication and protecting data.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="give-me-a-list-of-example-tls-cipher-suites">Give me a list of example TLS Cipher Suites<a href="#give-me-a-list-of-example-tls-cipher-suites" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Give me a list of example TLS Cipher Suites" title="Direct link to Give me a list of example TLS Cipher Suites">​</a></h2><p>Some common TLS cipher suites are:</p><p>TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256
TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256
TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256
TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256</p><p>Note that this list is not exhaustive and the available cipher suites depend on the specific TLS implementation used.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-is-the-difference-between-ecdhe-dhe-and-rsa">What is the difference between ECDHE, DHE and RSA?<a href="#what-is-the-difference-between-ecdhe-dhe-and-rsa" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What is the difference between ECDHE, DHE and RSA?" title="Direct link to What is the difference between ECDHE, DHE and RSA?">​</a></h2><p>ECDHE, DHE, and RSA are algorithms used in secure communication, specifically in establishing secure connections between clients and servers.</p><p>ECDHE (Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman) is a key agreement protocol that enables two parties to establish a shared secret over an insecure channel. ECDHE uses elliptic curve cryptography, which provides strong security with relatively short keys.</p><p>DHE (Diffie-Hellman) is a key agreement protocol that enables two parties to establish a shared secret over an insecure channel. DHE is similar to ECDHE, but uses a different mathematical structure, the Diffie-Hellman group, to generate a shared secret.</p><p>RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) is an encryption and digital signature algorithm used for secure communication. RSA is used to encrypt and decrypt messages and to digitally sign messages to verify their authenticity.</p><p>In TLS Cipher Suites, the algorithms RSA, DHE, and ECDHE are used to negotiate the key exchange between the client and the server. The specific combination of algorithms in a cipher suite determines the strength of the encryption and authentication used in the secure communication.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-is-aes-gcm-sha">What is AES, GCM, SHA?<a href="#what-is-aes-gcm-sha" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What is AES, GCM, SHA?" title="Direct link to What is AES, GCM, SHA?">​</a></h2><p>AES, GCM, and SHA are encryption and authentication algorithms:</p><p>AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) is a symmetric encryption algorithm that is widely used for data encryption.</p><p>GCM (Galois/Counter Mode) is an authenticated encryption algorithm that provides both confidentiality and integrity for data. It is a mode of operation for the AES encryption algorithm.</p><p>SHA (Secure Hash Algorithm) is a family of cryptographic hash functions that are widely used for message authentication and integrity. Different variants of SHA exist, including SHA-1, SHA-2, and SHA-3.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="tell-me-more-about-sha-secure-hash-algorithm">Tell me more about SHA (Secure Hash Algorithm)<a href="#tell-me-more-about-sha-secure-hash-algorithm" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Tell me more about SHA (Secure Hash Algorithm)" title="Direct link to Tell me more about SHA (Secure Hash Algorithm)">​</a></h2><p>Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA) is a family of cryptographic hash functions designed by the National Security Agency (NSA) and published by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The most widely used SHA algorithms are SHA-1, SHA-2, and SHA-3. The main purpose of a SHA function is to take an input message of arbitrary length and produce a fixed-length output (referred to as a &quot;hash value&quot;) that is unique to the unique values of the input. The hash value is used to verify the integrity of the original data and to detect any tampering that may have occurred during transmission or storage. The security of a SHA function depends on its ability to generate hash values that are difficult to reproduce and predict, making it suitable for use in digital signatures, authentication, and message integrity verification.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-does-the-abinitio-multiplexer-do">What does the Abinitio multiplexer do?<a href="#what-does-the-abinitio-multiplexer-do" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What does the Abinitio multiplexer do?" title="Direct link to What does the Abinitio multiplexer do?">​</a></h2><p>In Ab Initio, the Multiplexer component is used for creating multiple output streams from a single input stream. It splits the input stream into several output streams based on some conditions and sends each output stream to a different processing path. The conditions can be based on the data content, metadata, or a combination of both.</p><p>The Ab Initio Multiplexer component is useful when you want to process the data in different ways, depending on the values of certain fields or conditions within the data. For example, you may have a data file that contains information about customers and their orders. You may want to split the file into different output streams based on the country in which the customer resides or based on the type of product they purchased. You can use the Multiplexer component to split the data into multiple output streams based on these conditions.</p><p>Overall, the Ab Initio Multiplexer component is a powerful tool that allows you to efficiently process and manage large volumes of data by distributing it to different processing paths based on specific conditions.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="is-the-multiplexer-process-always-running-or-is-it-started-up-temporarily-when-processing-jobs-in-abinitio">Is the multiplexer process always running or is it started up temporarily when processing jobs in abinitio?<a href="#is-the-multiplexer-process-always-running-or-is-it-started-up-temporarily-when-processing-jobs-in-abinitio" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Is the multiplexer process always running or is it started up temporarily when processing jobs in abinitio?" title="Direct link to Is the multiplexer process always running or is it started up temporarily when processing jobs in abinitio?">​</a></h2><p>The Ab Initio Multiplexer component is not a standalone process that runs independently of other Ab Initio processes. Instead, it is a component that is used within an Ab Initio graph or data processing application to split a single input stream into multiple output streams based on specified conditions.</p><p>When you design an Ab Initio graph or data processing application that includes a Multiplexer component, it is not running all the time, but it will be executed temporarily as part of the processing jobs. When the Ab Initio graph or application is run, the Multiplexer component will be started up as part of the job and will process the input data based on the specified conditions, creating the output streams as required.</p><p>The Ab Initio software platform is designed to process large volumes of data and handle complex data integration scenarios, and the Multiplexer component is just one of many tools provided to achieve this. Ab Initio graphs or data processing applications can be executed on-demand or scheduled to run at specified intervals, depending on the needs of the organization.</p></div><footer
