We were woken up last night at about 1:30 AM by a police helicopter, it was circling around and hovering quite low.

Apparently at the end of the street people hand claimed that a car had driven off the cliff.



This morning there were helicopters and police boats around the area looking for the car.

There was fairly large swell today and during the afternoon one of the police boats had become beached on the rocks.

A crowd gathered and news crews arrived to film the event.

Where the car had driven off the cliff there were large waves breaking on the rocks making it difficult for the police divers.
Apparently one of the boats had a power issue and needed to be towed, the tow rope snapped and the boat became stuck on the rocks.

The police had prevented people from getting close to see the boat so people dangerously climbed along the cliffs to have a look and take selfies
