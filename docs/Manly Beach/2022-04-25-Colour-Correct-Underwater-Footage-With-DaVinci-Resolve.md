title: Colour Correcting Underwater Footage With DaVinci Resolve

date: 2022-04-25

A while ago I went camping with my family to Narrabeen Caravan Park, while there I took some underwater video of various sea creatures with my Sony Action camera.

The original video I captured didn't look that great, but I was able to fix it up using video editing software called DaVinci Resolve.

This video will demonstrate how I colour corrected the underwater footage with a couple of example clips :

<iframe width="100%" height="600px" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1UEKSnMZw28" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

you can download the sample underwater video clips if you want to practice doing colour correction from here :
