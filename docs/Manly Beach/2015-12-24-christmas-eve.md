I deciced to focus on the seagulls this morning as the waves were small and mushy.
One more sleep until Christmas, this year has gone by fast. There is going to be a [Camel Parade](http://hellomanly.com.au/events/st-matthews-manly-christmas-eve-camel-parade?format=html) today on the Corso in front of St Matthew's Anglican Church at 2:30pm
so I might go down and take some more photos this afternoon. Any hoo, Merry Christmas everyone and a Happy New Year!
In the mean time enjoy these photos I've selected for today's post.
