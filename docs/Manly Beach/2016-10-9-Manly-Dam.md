Can't believe I've lived in Manly for over two years and never bothered to venture out to Manly Dam.

It's a 10 minute drive from Manly but when you're there it feels like you're hours outside of Sydney.

It has toilets, BBQ's, Swimming, boat ramp, Water Skiing, a kids playground, walking tracks, fishing is allowed.

Parking is metered at about $5 an hour but you can park outside the park and walk in.

Will definitely be exploring this place more.
