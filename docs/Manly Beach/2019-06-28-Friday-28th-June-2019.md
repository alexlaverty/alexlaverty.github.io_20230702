Was up early this morning so I thought I'd head down to Manly Beach to take some photos, I haven't had a chance to get out in a long time so was good to get out.

Decided to take out the Canon 5D Mark ii, I also had to check to see if my 300mm Canon lens still works after Harry decided to take it off the shelf and throw it across the room the other day...

Walking down to the beach in the dark this morning I thought I'd be the only one down there
