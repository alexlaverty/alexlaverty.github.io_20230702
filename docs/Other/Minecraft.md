## What are the steps to install Minecraft mods?

Installing mods in Minecraft can be done using the following steps:

* Download Minecraft Forge: Minecraft Forge is a modding platform that makes it easy to install and manage mods in Minecraft.
Download the latest version of Forge from the official website and follow the instructions to install it :
<https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/>

* Download the mod: Find the mod you want to install, such as SEUS Renewed, BSL Shaders, Chocapic13's Shaders, Kuda Shaders, or NaturalVision Remastered, and download the mod file. Make sure the mod is compatible with the version of Minecraft you are using and with the version of Forge you have installed.

* Install the mod: Copy the downloaded mod file into the "mods" folder in your Minecraft directory. The location of this folder will vary depending on your operating system, but it can usually be found in the following directory: %appdata%.minecraft\mods

* Launch Minecraft: Start Minecraft and click on the "Mods" option in the main menu. Make sure the mod you installed is listed and enabled.

Configure the mod: Some mods come with configuration files that allow you to adjust settings and customize the mod's behavior. These files can usually be found in the "config" folder within the Minecraft directory.
