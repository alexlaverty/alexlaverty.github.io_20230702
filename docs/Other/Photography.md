## What is the best way to organise large numbers of digital photos on local file storage?

Organizing large numbers of digital photos on local file storage can be a daunting task, but there are several strategies you can use to make it more manageable. Here are some tips to help you organize your photos:

* Create a folder structure: Start by creating a hierarchical folder structure that makes sense to you. For example, you could have a top-level folder called "Photos" and then create subfolders for each year, with further subfolders for each event or occasion within that year.

* Use descriptive file names: Give your photos descriptive file names that help you remember what they are. For example, instead of naming a file "IMG_1234.jpg", name it something like "BeachVacation_2019_001.jpg".

* Add metadata: Many photo management software applications allow you to add metadata to your photos, such as tags, captions, and ratings. This can make it easier to find specific photos later on.

Use keywords and tags: Use keywords and tags to categorize your photos. For example, you could tag photos by location, people, or event type.

Use a consistent naming convention: If you have multiple people contributing photos to your collection, use a consistent naming convention to keep everything organized. For example, you could use a format like "YYYY-MM-DD_Location_EventName_PhotographerName.jpg".

Back up your photos: Finally, make sure to back up your photos regularly to protect against data loss. You could use an external hard drive or cloud storage service to create a backup of your photo collection.
