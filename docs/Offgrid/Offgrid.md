## What are the scales of permanence when looking for an offgrid property?

The scales of permanence are a set of principles used to guide the design and development of sustainable, regenerative properties, including off-grid properties. The scales are arranged in order of permanence, with the most permanent elements listed first. Here are the scales of permanence when looking for an off-grid property:

* Climate: The climate of the property is the most permanent factor to consider, as it cannot be easily changed. The climate affects everything from water availability to soil quality to the types of plants and animals that can thrive on the property.

* Landform: The topography of the land is the second most permanent factor to consider, as it also cannot be easily changed. The landform affects water flow, soil erosion, and other important aspects of the ecosystem.

* Water: Water is essential for off-grid living, so it's important to consider the availability, quality, and reliability of water sources on the property. This includes both surface water (streams, rivers, ponds) and groundwater (wells).

* Access: Access to the property is important for transportation, delivery of supplies, and emergency services. Consider the condition of roads, bridges, and other access points.

* Structures: The existing structures on the property, such as buildings and fences, can provide a foundation for off-grid living. Consider the condition and quality of these structures, as well as their suitability for your needs.

* Zones: The property can be divided into zones based on different uses, such as agriculture, forestry, and residential. Consider the needs of each zone and how they can be integrated into a cohesive whole.

* Soil: Soil quality affects the productivity and health of plants and animals on the property. Consider the type, texture, and fertility of the soil, as well as any issues with erosion or contamination.

* Microclimate: The microclimate of the property, including factors such as sunlight exposure and wind patterns, can affect the growth and health of plants and animals.

* Flora and fauna: The plant and animal species on the property are an important part of the ecosystem. Consider the biodiversity of the property and how it can be protected and enhanced.

* Human ecology: The people who live on the property are also part of the ecosystem. Consider the social and cultural aspects of off-grid living, as well as the economic and political context of the area.

## Taking into account all the scales of permanence, what are some of the best locations to live in australia for an offgrid lifestyle?

Choosing the best location in Australia for an off-grid lifestyle will depend on your individual needs and preferences. However, here are some general considerations based on the scales of permanence:

* Climate: Australia has a range of different climates, from tropical to temperate to arid. Some areas, such as northern Queensland and the Top End, have a wet season and a dry season, while others, such as the south-eastern states, have a more temperate climate with distinct seasons. Consider the climate that best suits your needs and preferences, as well as the availability of water sources and potential challenges such as extreme heat or bushfires.

* Landform: Australia has a diverse range of landforms, including mountains, forests, deserts, and coastlines. Some areas, such as the Great Dividing Range or the Kimberley region, offer unique challenges and opportunities for off-grid living. Consider the topography of the land and its potential impact on water flow, soil erosion, and other important factors.

* Water: Water is a critical resource for off-grid living, and Australia has many areas with limited water availability. Consider the availability and quality of water sources, such as rivers, streams, lakes, and groundwater, as well as the potential for rainwater harvesting and other water conservation measures.

* Access: Consider the accessibility of the property, including roads, bridges, and other access points. Some areas of Australia, such as remote regions of the Northern Territory or Western Australia, may have limited access to goods and services.

* Structures: Consider the existing structures on the property, such as buildings, fences, and other infrastructure. Depending on your needs and preferences, you may be looking for a property with existing structures that can be adapted for off-grid living, or a property that is a blank slate for your own construction projects.

* Zones: Consider the zoning regulations and land use policies in the area, as well as the potential for different zones on the property, such as agriculture, forestry, and residential.

* Soil: Consider the type, texture, and fertility of the soil on the property, as well as any issues with erosion or contamination. Some areas of Australia, such as the fertile soils of the Riverina region in New South Wales or the red soils of the Kimberley, may offer unique opportunities for agriculture and other forms of food production.

* Microclimate: Consider the microclimate of the property, including factors such as sunlight exposure and wind patterns. Some areas of Australia, such as the coast of Western Australia or the highlands of Tasmania, may offer unique microclimates that are well-suited to off-grid living.

* Flora and fauna: Consider the biodiversity of the property and the potential impact of your off-grid lifestyle on local plant and animal species. Australia has many unique and fragile ecosystems, so it's important to consider the impact of your activities on the local environment.

* Human ecology: Consider the social and cultural aspects of off-grid living in Australia, as well as the economic and political context of the area. Some areas of Australia, such as the Northern Rivers region of New South Wales or the Margaret River region of Western Australia, have thriving communities of off-grid and sustainable living enthusiasts, while others may be more isolated.
