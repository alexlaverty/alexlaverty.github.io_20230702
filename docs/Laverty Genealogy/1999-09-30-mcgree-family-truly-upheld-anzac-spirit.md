McGree family truly upheld ANZAC Spirit

If ANY family understood the sacrifices of ANZAC was the McGrees of Taylors Arm. James and Bridget McGree sent four sons to World War I yet only one came home. How deep and profound must their sorrow have been? There was mourning on both sides of the Tasman for the McGrees as two of their boys were killed action fighting for the New Zealand Expeditionary Force (NZEF).

The Taylors Arm War Memorial situated against serene backdrop of rolling tree covered hills and in children's playground.... stark contrast to bloody battlefields of Gallipoli and Western Front.

The McGree brothers' names are also on cenotaph Bowraville. Patrick Joseph McGree, born 1883, enlisted at Taruheru, Gisborne, and was killed August 8, 1915. He fell Chunuk Bair, the highest point ANZACS reached Gallipoli and where today impressive stone monument records names more than 800 officers men of NZEF who died 1915 and who have known grave, including the brave boy from Taylors Arm.

John Ambrose McGree, born 1892, signed on for duty with Australian Imperial Force just 18 days after Patrick had fallen and left Australia with the Infantry Battalion, 1 Reinforcements, five days after Christmas 1915 aboard HMAT Medic.

The 22-year-old's enlistment papers describe him as fit with "fresh. complexion", good eyesight, 5 feet inches (174 centimetres) tall and 126 pounds (57 kilograms)-in other words, young, lean and keen-ideal attributes for soldier. John stepped ashore Alexandria on March 29, 1916 and then went straight to the front, disembarking Marseilles six days later. Taken on strength into the Battalion at Ã‰taples, John sustained gunshot wounds to the back chest on July 25,1916 and, sadly, died of his wounds the next day. He was buried Warloy-Baillon Military Cemetery in the Somme by war chaplain, Reverend Samuel J Gosling. A heartbroken Mrs McGree wrote to Army Base Records in Melbourne on August 29 asking for details of his death and burial and if anyone knew "what were his last words".

On July 18, 1918, Michael Dennis McGree, born 1890, was killed in action in France whilst fighting for the NZEF and buried in Gommecourt Wood New Cemetery, Foncquevillers. At the time, Michael was reported as missing action. While awaiting news about his fate, McGree fractured a rib in a sulky accident and was taken to Kempsey Hospital. She suffered more pain than mother should bear.
