War-time mystery leads two men to Taylors Arm

A year-long mystery of mistaken names, hours of research and miles of travelling has finally led two men- one from Melbourne and one from London - to a possible solution in the small country village of Taylors Arm.

David Sandground and Michael Long took possession of some valuable pieces of photographic wartime histo- ry in 1998 and have spent almost two years since trying to find the pho- tographs' rightful owner.

Michael, an archivist and former teacher at London's Kingsbury High School, was given the photos during a trip to Northern France.

After one wrong name and countless phone calls and e-mails, the pair has finally identified the faces in their pho tographs: brothers Patrick and John McGree, both killed during World War One.

David and Michael are now trying to track a Mr and Mrs McGree, believed to live at Taylors Arm.

They are keen to get the photographs back to relatives of the brothers and would be happy to hear from anyone with information.

If you have any information on the McGree family, call David Sandground on (03) 9625 0354.
