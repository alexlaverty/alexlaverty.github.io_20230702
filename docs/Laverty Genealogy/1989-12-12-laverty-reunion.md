Sir

Laverty reunion The Laverty family whose obstinacy gave

the area the separation of Upper and Lower Taylors Arm holds a reunion on Saturday and Sunday. Many of the family are still in the Macleay-Nambucca regions.

Others will travel from South Australia, Victoria and Queensland, and even from New Zealand for the reunion, to be held at the

Macksville Showground.

An open air mass is planned at 9am on Sunday. The Laverty family, with a rather complicated family tree, has as its crest Fortune Favours the Brave but it is not known exactly why labourer, Michael Laverty fled Ballymyhinch, County Down, for England half way through last century.

Unusually for his time, he could read and write, and at Chiltern Moor, Cumberland, met and then married at Workington another Catholic, Sarah McCormick.

They and three children were assisted migrants when the St Hilda arrived at Port Jackson on February 4, 1865. A brother in law, Auguste Raymonde, was then living at Pola Creek.

Family records say they settled at Pola Creek, then (?) near Kinchela, but because of flooding moved to an area to become known as Laverty's Plains near Taylors Arm in 1884. A son, Dennis Laverty, born at Chiltern and five when they shipped for the colony, and his bride, Nora Goldspring, were to be the first couple married in the old Catholic Church on Wards Farm, the amorous suitor riding 80 miles (129km) to Orara near Coffs Harbour to do his courting. He selected his homestead, Oakvale, in 1883 and built his home in 1902.

Around the same time a John Laverty (Snr)

selected land near the present Taylors Arm

Hall. Sam Laverty, a son by a previous

marriage of the immigrant Michael, had

subsequently followed his father to Australia and selected across the river. When a milk factory was planned a site on Sam's farm was selected - but he refused to sell and the factory was moved to a site farther upstream to bring the separation of today's

Upper and Lower Taylor's Arm.

Adding further piquancy to the family tree,

Dennis Laverty's Nora was the daughter of an Elizabeth Donnelly (nee Robertson or Ribinson) who had married a John Goldspring - after first being married to a Michael Donnelly, producing two sons. She left her husband because of his drinking and following his death married Goldspring (an Irish builder and the son of a herring fisherman) who had travelled the world and a number of goldfields.

Family sources say the family was well off, but were forced to leave Ireland when "the i English confiscated their property, arriving in NSW via the USA.

A family book and other memorabilia will be on sale at the reunion.
