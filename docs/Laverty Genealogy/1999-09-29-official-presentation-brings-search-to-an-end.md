Regular readers of the Mid-Coast Observer may remember a number of articles on two photographs taken during World War One of brothers Patrick and John McGree.

The search for identity of the brothers led two men - Michael Long from England and Melbourne's David Sandground - on a world-wide search, eventually ending in the small farming village of Taylors Arm.

Two stories were run in this paper, asking anyone who knew the identity of the young men to come forward. And it worked.

The two men received numerous calls from people who were related to, or knew of the McGree boys. Taylors Arm Sub-Branch members also offered their assistance.

And on October 3, the photographs will take their rightful place during an official presentation to be held at noon.

Taylors Arm Sub-Branch members are now completing arrangements for Mr Sandground to hand over these unique pieces of wartime history to members of the McGree family.

The presentation will coincide with another special event in Taylors Arm history - the unveiling and dedication of a plaque to those who gave their lives to our country.

All relatives, friends and interested people are invited to attend this histor ical event. Organisers expect a large attendance of neighbouring sub branch members to witness the occa sion.
