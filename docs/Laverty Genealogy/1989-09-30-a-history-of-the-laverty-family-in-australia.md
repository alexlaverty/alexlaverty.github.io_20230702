Edited by  Carol (Laverty) Harris 1989

When I agreed to compile this book in readiness for the Laverty Re-union which will be held in October of 1989, 1 had little idea about the breadth of information it would contain. I knew there would be lots to record since the "Taylors Arm" Laverty's to which I belong, all were good Catholic breaders with large families. I was unaware of The "Limerick" Lavertys and the "Nhill" Lavertys (as I have come to dub them on the computer files), and of the various paths. their lives have taken.

From my work it has become obvious that there are some fundamental qualities which pervade the family. That seems to be a wit which reveals itself in story telling; a basic hard working drive which overcomes enormous odds; and a great pride in being part of the clan.

It has almost become a standing joke in my own family that everytime anyone does anything praiseworthy the catchery will be "Of course..She's/He's a Laverty!". We grew up with. that encouragement and pride being described to us by our Father. There was never ever any expectation that we would fail at anything we set our sights upon. I am very grateful for that belief in myself and my own worth which was passed on to me by my Father because " I was a Laverty".

I believe that while times have changed, and while we may seem occassionally to wonder if the old ways were better, that the Lavertys of our present generation are possessive of the same qualities that have distinguished our family for generations. We are still quickwitted and love a good story: we still give our all to the work we do whether it is on the land, in business, in the arts, or in services to our community; and we still are proud of who we are... The Laverty Clan.

Should I have overlooked any of the material that was

submitted for publication I make apologies. This compilation

has been a substantial task. Hopefully if may be the "first draft" of a more comprehensive History which someone else may tackle for the future. Thanks needs to be placed to my Father for his persistent questioning about how the book was coming along, even if my answers were often curt and sometimes unprintable; to my

Aunts Dorothy and Noreen who have been the primary

organizers and movers of this mammoth event; and to my

daughter Michelle for her assistance with the cartoons and

graphics which I hope will add an individual flavour to the text. I would like to dedicate my efforts in this venture to my sister, Toni, who was tragically taken from us in April of this year. She was excited about the prospect of the ru-union and was responsible for the invitations which you

have recieved.

Carol (Laverty) Harris.

## FORWARD;

My first real interest in tracing my Family Tree began, I think, on the day of 6-7-1982.. On that day, my Mother spent most of the day at our home. She talked all through lunch and the afternoon about her childhood, her parents; Dad's family of her growing up in the Daweson Valley in Queensland where she met Dad working in the Cotton Fields. Then as a young bride of eighteen she came to settle at Taylor's Arm never to see her parents again.

All afternoon she talked, as if she had not told us

everything, reluctant to go home - as if she would remember

something else. Little did we know that it was to be our

last talk together. My mother was getting ready for Mass a

few hours later when God called her home.

How I wish I could remember all she and Dad had told me over

the years. So on behalf of my Sister Noreen and her family: my brother Colin and his Daughters Carol and Toni; My Cousin Angela who has provided the paintings; to our Partners for their patience and tolerance; and to my Daughter Kathryn, I dedicate this book to My Parents; to all our Parents; Our Ansestors.

It is to those that we pay tribute for our start in life,

for by their hard work and their faith they instilled in us.

Through their endurance they provided a sound basis for A better life for us their families. So many of them had to leave Ireland and England, because of petty ideals; their land was taken from them and they fled

to Australia to make a new start. To them we owe a debt of thanks and gratitude. So this book

is for them, compiled with love, and memories, many hours of working and searching, and many sleepless nights.

I hope it is worthy of them. Dorothy (Laverty) Clarke.


## THE ORIGIN OF THE NAME: "LAVERTY".

The original name of O'Flaithbhearthaig comes down to us as

Flaherty or Laverty, with or without the "0".

The O'Flahertys possessed the territory on the east side of Lough Corrib until the thirteenth century when, under pressure from the Anglo-Norman penetration into Connacht, they moved westward to the other side of the lake and settled there.

The chieftancy continued until the beginning of the eighteenth century. British statistics show that the Flaherty's and O'Flahertys are still much more numerous in their original habitat, County Galway than anywhere else. The same surname is found in Ulster, but there the initial "F" is aspirated thus altering the pronunciation and producing the form O"Laverty, which approximates phonetically to the aspirated Irish form. The scept was regarded as distinct from the Galway one, and was centred on County Donegal.


There have been some interesting replies from people all over the country, and some from overseas who bear the Laverty name. While it is possible that there are connections in the line back in The Ireland of the early 1800's, I have not been able to see these from the information provided here. However this is all included in the hope that someone out there may decide to take up the task of tracing back and recognizing the origins of us all. I quote verbatum from the letters that have arrived.

## Collection of Letters

"Dear Sister Denise,

Sister Leonie gave me you address a long time ago so you can see how good I am at writing letters. However, I had just had to take this opportunity of sending you a card to let you know there are laverty's in this part of the country

also. (Ontario, Canada). I am the only girl among five bays. My parents (Peter and Bridget) are both dead. My youngest brother is 67. I may as well send you my picture also, a poor one that you

can now tear up. I am in my seventieth year. This picture was taken last year. Be assured of my prayers that you may have a joyous and Blessed Christmas.

We have some snow only today. Love in Christ

Sister Mary Laverty.I.B.V.M.

I was born in Downpatrick County Down Ireland. My wife Moira Clare was born in Lisburn, County Down. For the last six years we remained in Ireland we lived in a fishing village called Araglass which is seven miles from Downpatrick and thirty miles from Belfast. This is where we met and married. We came to Australia in 1956 and settled in Adelaide. We have six children, all of whom were born in Adelaide. They range in ane from 20 35 and are named: Patrick, Keiron, Catherine, gerald, Damoon, and Ronan. My father and Grandfather were born Townland of Leganaddy which is four miles from Downpatrick.

P.O. Box 32, Miles. Qld. 4415. June 29, 1989.

Dear Mrs Clarke,

My Father in law passed on the Laverty family reunion registration form and enclosed notes on the Lavertys, and on your family in particular. He said he had written to you but. has not as yet heard back. I have put the family particulars in the Old and Victorian

Genealogical Society journals but have not got anywhere. Are

all the Laverty's in N.S.W.??

My husband was born at Corryong in Victoria. His father is Harold Francis Laverty, mother Norma Jean nee Nugent. His Grandfather was Andrew Francis Laverty, born 1876 in Singleton and married Grace Henrietta Hempenstall. His great Grandfather was James Laverty born 1846 at Heidelberg and who married Agnes Boyd. His Great Great GrandFather was also James and was born in Ireland. He married Elizabeth Dunlop in Ireland but all their children were born in

Australia. This James was born circa 1810. His father was

also James Laverty, a farmer, but mother's name unknown

according to his death certificate. Anyway James and

Elizabeth had seven children. They were John, Elizabeth,

James, Joseph, Robert, and William living in 1894 when their

Father died, and Sarah Anne was deceased by then. I don't

know anything about any apart from James.

My Father-in-law knew little about his family and thought

that the James who married Agnes Boyd was the first to come. to Australia. The family story is that he was a guard on a convict ship. Possible his Father was the quard but I can't find any evidence for this, or for that matter, against it. It seems odd that there isn't any known decendants of James' brothers John, Joseph, Robert or William, known to the family. In 1894 they were aged from 33 to 58 years. As my in-laws didn't come to Queensland until 1946, have relatives in Victoria, and visit occassionally, it isn't as if there has been a breakdown in communication. Unless they didn't marry, and just died out that way, it would seem there must be some decendants somewhere and it would be nice to find them.

We cannot unfortunately, attend the reunion, but I hope it is a successful one for you all. We were at Singleton over the Easter week-end to attend a Squire reunion- my Mother was a Squire. We have four school aged children - one in year 12- and this reunion is in our school term. Yours sincerely Patricia A. Laverty.

This exert came attached to the above letter and is a resume from Harold Francis Laverty who is Patricia's Father-in-law.

"I was born at Albury (3/9/10) and lived at Birringanna. district midway between Tallangatta and Corryong. My wife lived here and was born on the First of March, 1914. We were married on 23, April, 1934. and celebrated our 55th Wedding Anniversary last month.

We have two sons Laurie (24/5/35), and Max (6/6/36). My Great Grandfather James was born in Northern Ireland. My Grandfather was born in Heidelberg near Melbourne. He was a policeman and worked at Melbourne and Singleton. I resided in Melbourne and served in the Field Artillery 27 pounder and gained the rank of Sergent. I served for four and a half years and was discharged on 1/1/46. We then moved to Miles Queensland.

I have found amongst the pieces of information that were handed to me a family tree which traces a connection between Robert Haswell and Elizabeth Francis. It contains no dates. and has affixed to it The following Note "Joseph Bernett Laverty left Hertleport 1926 and

came to New Zealand. He was a ships engineer. They were Gospel and Anglicant. My Mother Susan Devlin, is a Roman Catholic and all six children. that she and my father had are likewise. So it looks as though we have come full circle

Sr. Joanna (Maurya Laverty,"

The data shows the following information: Robert and Elizabeth's daughter married a Michael Laverty. They in Lurn had two children Hanna and James. James married Hannah Leonard and produced six children. The Joseph Bernett referred to in the above note was the second of these and appears to be Sr Joanna's Grandfather. Joseph married H.Lister and she bore him seven children. The second last of these was a set of twins. The oldest, Joseph, carried. Sup Devlin, the mother referred to above. I am uncertain of where this information originated from and just how it fits the overall pattern, but I have included it in case it fills a gap for someone reading these documents.



## Dur Story.

Denis, Catherine and Sarah Laverty arrived with their parents, Michael and Sarah, (who was a sister to John McCormack) on the St Hilda in 1856. Michael and Sarah had been married at Workington. They had been forced to flee Ireland and lived in England for a ti before coming to Australia. They had a brother-in-law,

Auguste Raymonde, living at Polar Creek, Port Macquarie, and that is where they went after arriving in Sydney. They stayed there until they decided to purchase land Taylors Arm. The area is still known as Laverty's Plains, and is still owned by Lavertys today. Michael had been married previously and had a son sam, who later followed him to Taylors Arm. Michael and Sarah had six children: Michael, Denis, Mary Anne, John, Catherine and Sarah. at

Sam and Sarah never married, and it is the descendents of

the remaining five which this history traces.

The older Lavertys were mostly farmers, bushmen and builders. They used to cut their own sleepers from the trees they fell, which they then cut into slabs with a broad axe. Many a time I helped my Dad use the wedges and crowbar to split posts and timber. I can still see him making his own boats; how we used to stoke the copper up to keep the water boiling to bend the planks. Then the copper would be used to boil the bark from the trees to stain the nets a dark colour. Dad always said the darker the net, the mare fish you caught. One day Dad arrived home pushing the bike with a big Jew fish hanging from the front handlebars, and dangling over the back wheels. I can still see that fish. Dad had a big grin that morning.

There are still today Builders and Fisherman amongst us, but our numbers now include such diverse occupations as Teachers; Lawyers; Nuns; Priests; Doctors; Upholsterers; Draftsmen and Scientists. We still seem to maintain an interest in music, and there is part of the story teller in us all.

"Dear Sarah,

Granny Laverty was born in the same place as John McCormack the singer. The anly McCormicks who lived there were Granny's cousins. When Granny left that part of Ireland she was married to a tall Irish man, Michael Laverty. It seems he had three brothers. Dad told me that he thought. two of them went to America, and that possibly the third came to

Australia. But they never heard from them at all. Granny and Grandfather went to England. They stayed there a while and then came to Australia. At that time Dad was about two years old. He was running around with the sailors and fell down a port hole and needed seven stitches in his head. He had white hair and his brothers used to call him a little Pom. Dad used to tell them straight he was no Pommie. He would tell them if a cat had kittens in a oven you would not

call them loaves of broad. When they came to Australia first they lived at Polar Creek near the Macleay (Kempsey) then later selected farming land on the Nambucca River at Taylors Arm. One brother of Grandfather's stayed in England by all accounts. Grandfather never knew. Leo Flemming, our cousin, met the Laverly family in England during the first world war. There were twins in the family so that seems to follow.

suit in the Lavertys here also. Yes, I recieved your letter which was a long time getting here. Grandfather Laver ty died in Kempsey an ulcer burst in his stomach. Granny lived until she was 96. Aunty Sarah looked after her. love (ram

Pat and Leo"

## Michael Andrew Laverty

Michael Andrew Laverty was born August 26, 1909, the son of Michael and Catherine Laverty. He was educated at Taylors Arm and Bowraville. After he married he and Edna lived for short time with Michel's parents until their own house was completed. a

Mike, as he was known, dairy farmed all his life, rearing

sheep and pigs as well. The cows were originally milked by

hand before machinery was installed.

Butter milk was pumped from the local butter factory,

through pipes, to large vats at the pig styes. A whistle would be blown to notify that the milk was on its way. Some years later he bought a second farm, share farming it until Alan was able to take it over. A third farm was bought from Rhupert Flemming across from where the old Medlow school was. Son Pat, and wife Mary, took over the running of this property. Mike was a keen axemen, taking an interest in the woodchops at the local rodeos and shows. He loved helping people. One particular instance comes to mind. A couple from Sydney had a canoe and were camping near the bridge. It set in to rain. and the creeks were rising. So Mike went and bought them

home and they stayed a week. He was proud of his religion; the rosary would be said every night after tea, mostly before the washing up was done. His pride and joy was his car, a 1929 Dodge, which was cleaned after each use. After the sudden death of his wife his health suffered and he declined noticably. He moved from Laverty's Plains to the village of Taylors Arm, and died shortly afterwards on December 2, 1975.

Denis Laverty married Nora Goldspring, and were the first to be joined in that union in the old Church on Wards farm. Before they were married, Denis used to ride from Taylors Arm to Orara (West of Coffs Harbour) to visit Nora, a distance of B0 miles. The site of the homestead "Oakville" was selected by Denis on 4-10-1883, and the house was built in 1902

John, meanwhile selected land near the present Taylors Arm hall. Sam selected across the river. When the milk factory was to be built a site was selected at Lower Taylors Arm on Sam's property. But Sam refused to sell the land and another site was chosen further up, hence the separation of the township...upper and lower Taylors Arm.

## MY CHILDHOOD DAYS By Dorothy (Laverty) Clarke

My first memories are of going to Mass and the Missions. How I loved those sermons. They made you sit up and think. No swear words in those days. I bet a lot of you still remember

Fr. Goss. My first day at school was a disaster, crying for big brother Col, and chewing my hankie up until it was in pieces.

I can still see my mother washing at the well, always with a wet apron, from scrubbing on the washing board. How her knuckles must have hurt. Whoever was the baby used to sit or sleep in a big box, used for packing bananas. The clothes line was a wire line strung up between the camphor laurel trees, propped up with a big stick, or pole, (clothes prop).

I'll always remember Dad for his singing around the open fire, and how we always had a winner for the best singer, and I only realised as I grew older, that each one had a turn at winning that sixpence! That was first prize! Dad used to borrow a truck from Jack Chapman once a month to take us to the crossing for a swim, and the best part was. having an ice cream at Petros (now Big Jim's) on the way home. We all had a share of the yard to keep clean, and we took so much pride in doing just that. We used to go over near the railway line each afternoon to fetch a load of wood or brambles (small wood). We would go home from school and have our bread and syrup or jam, do our jobs, and then play in our cubby house, mostly built amongst the wattle trees ar lantana bushes. Dad used to make us toys from small pieces of wood, like trucks, aeroplanes and dolls out of pegs. He always carried a pocket knife in his pocket, and you could see him whittling away.

Times used to be very hard, and they had to clear the virgin land with horses, sythes, brush hooks, cross cut saws and all rough tools. They would plant their crops and so many time see the bandicoot or wallaby or wild pigs destroy them. They grew a lot of pumpkin, potato and corn. They all hunted

and went after pigeon and wild turkey. with my Dad, they went to Burrapine to Even and Lizzy Kirkmans. When they pulled up Bede thought he was outside St Mary's Cathederal as they were saying the Litany, and all they could hear from outside was the chorus "Pray for us" "Pray for us".

Dorothy Laverty Clarke.

Another true story is when our Mum, Florrie, won a cow in Church raffle. She traded her in for a washing machine. The electricity had only been on for a few months and I suppose mum thought that with eleven children the machine would be. worth more in the long run.

Norm Poole often laughed later as he said Mum did not know.

the cow was with calf. That made news in an English Journal! The cow was originally donated by Mr Ted Metz and I am pleased to say we are good friends with he and his wife

today. After that incident, we always kept a house cow anyway. For some reason or other they seemed to always be called Winnie, or Fairy or Daisy.

Dorothy Clarke.

1 well remember the war coupons. Many a time I lost them and did we get into trouble! I recall going to Reedy's (now the Dunhi vol and was so shy about going into the shop. I would way to my sister, Noreen, "You go in, it's your turn." After auch arquing we would go in together!. I can still remember the day I tore the coupons up and Mr Reedy would not accept Uom. If only he knew the trouble that caused! I still think of those days forty odd years later and the memories are very clear.

We used to go to Bobby Hodges for a billy of milk. On one articuler day I arrived at the big jacaranda tree, and went Lo Cake the hankle from around the handle, only to see the Bill yoll down the hill. manures of childhood are happy ones. I only regret not aking more notice when my parents were telling me things of b ulliy, Laverty Clarke.

## FOR MY NAN By Florrie Laverty

If there is one portrait in the gallery of my memory that lives more than the others it is that of my Grandfather.

The reflections that bounce from that mirror

are endless.

I watched as the days haul was bought home, and the scrawny lobster poked its feelers over the unfamiliar concrete And eagerly pulled the gut from the fish to show I was of the same caste. And later, in an unfamiliar bed, the reassurance and security of the warmth of an Irish song soft and comforting.

There was Eustie with his sack for naughty children ...so we believed...

and his bottle of wine. Long after, found dead in his shack.. three days

unnoticed.

My Grandfather must have the largest

repetoir of tall stories of any person I know, and even the mischevious glint of the boy long gone

cannot detract from the credibility.

There are two distinctive landmarks

about my Grandfather one is the early styled grey flannel shirt,

and the other is his sandshoes.

But these are only parts of the dregs of tobacco which fall to the floor from a roll your own; or the buts which burn down on the windowsill and floor while he watches the world from his silver pearch.

We went to "work" and sat on the edge of a graveside, and he

measured and dug.

And we talked about ripening bananas, and hid while the funeral service was on... So we could fill in the hole later on.

---

There has always been a gentleness.

he tried to disguise.

I saw it with the birth of my child.

Post Script.

Now you are gone

and there is a space in the gallery that is

Burning and botomless. Like losing a limb.

But I can see you, and hear you and watch you wink as you roar

for another pot of tea, and paint the kitchen the week before Christmas.

You cannot escape.

There is a seed that grows and preserves you and it lives in our imagination

and laughs, and chuckles, and

bellows with enjoyment. And you shake your fist at the shadowy figure

beckoning you to leave us.

But your spirit is in us and in our children

And you will never die.

## Michael Stephen Laverty

In memory of Pop, Michael Stephen Laverty, who departed this life May 6, 1977. Written by Linda Fuller when aged twelve. years.

We still see him quite clearly. As though he still were here

and sometimes when we think of him We shed a little tear. But we always go on loving him Like we always did And although we are all growing up Back then when we were kids. So God please look after him From all his family and me So when in turn our last days come Again our Pop we'll see.

FOR MICHAEL STEPHEN LAVERTY, MY POP.

By Stephen F. Clarke.

I'm writing from the toilet; hey it's a great place to You can gather up your thoughts, if you can just handle the

think stink.

I'd like to tell you about Pop, of his family and glory. A really great man, who could sure tell a story.

Now Pop had a mate, Chappie the Plumber, Well this pair had gone swimming at the beach down at Gumma. Well Pop had swum out, and Chappie for a bit of a lark, Thought "1'11 scare me old mate", so he yelled out "look! Shark"

Well, pop thought he was kidding, so he gave a wave and a grin, But his face turned to terror when he soon saw the fin.

And the shark headed for him.. It had to be thirty feet or

more And do you know? My pop beat the shark to the shore.

I'd just sit there and listen

Without making a sound.

Fair Dinkum! My Pop had to be the best swimmer around!

Then there was this bloke, a McKay I think, Who would often tell Pop how he could handle a drink. Well Pop thought he'd show him, he'd bring him undone A contest he thought and we'll go one for one. So after drinking for hours, McKay's speech became slurred. His eyes were all red. Everything was a blur. After drinking all day, McKay he did drop And the winner declared was my dear sober pop.

I'd just sit there and listen

Without making a sound. Fair Dinkum! My Pop had to be the best drinker around.

My memories of Pop, are that of a boy's.

Unspoilt memories, like old favourite toys. And that's the way it should stay, memories that were never boring. A bloke I called Pop.

He could sure tell a story!

Linoleum and Love

(For Michael and Florence Laverty, my Grandparents)

They were older then, like their kitchen floor,

linoleum and love worn together more

by each treading heart. They were never sure: Had they found happiness, or simply a way to endure?

My Grandfather's faithfulness was tough and taciturn.

Builder and fisherman, he did not learn

patience, except for fish. He'd hook his fingers in the air,

alive with cigarettes, and catch its burning as ashes in his hair. His eyes were full of stories we never dared

disbelieve. Looking back, I know he cared,

at least as best he could,

his hands hard with working over water and wood. Every time we visited, my grandmother gave us scraps. "For the dogs", she'd say.

Staying in love; knowing how to save,

make a little go a long way.

Such a brave economy of motion. It was the best lesson my grandmother taught,

something we might lean on. knowing how she'd fought

her way into believing. Her rough inuckled rosary, her tea-towel with its thin-skinned pride, were for her hope enough: a welcome knocking at the door, a veil drawn aside.

## Colin Laverty By Carol (Laverty) Harris

FRIDAY

(For my Dad: Colin Laverty)

We always ate fish on Friday.. And Dad bought lollies that he would hide.

Family ritual;

Catholic custom.

Keeping verandah vigil, peering between laticed windows.

He'd run outside

when we saw him coming.

Every week a new location

We would crawl and pry in pockets

And search for the elusive

packet of treasures.

li Lask was sweet but the game was better.

I remember we would go to the dances. Either by horse, or sulky. Many a waltz competition was entered and won. Most were musical and would play in the band: piano; drums; violin; spoons; mouth organ and gum leaf. The children would be taken along and when they went to sleep would be bedded down on dried corn husks on the stage.

In those time we all had chores to do. The worst was to go for the cows on cold frosty mornings. With little clothing to keep the body warm and no shoes on the feet we would hunt the cows up to stand in their beds and even stand in the fresh cow cakes for warmth!. Noreen Laverty Fuller.

My Mother (Sarah) taught Catechism for many years at the Taylors Arm Church. She also was sacristran and Church organist for some time. She instructed people in the Catholic faith, taught the boys the Latin and how to serve an the altar.

Clem, Gen, Norah (Kirkman) Len and John all helped in taking

care of the Church. Clem and Len taught Catechism for many

years as well. We had a nice choir. The main singers were Len and John. I was always proud to be related to the Laverty family, my mother being one. I can remember as a small child, they always prayed the Rosary.

Nora Laverty was my Grandmother. We loved her very much. She was a very special lady, so kind and gentle to all who knew her. She always gave the priest lunch after Mass and everyone loved her who knew her. To the Tobins she was like a doll with her pretty hats and dresses. What a great world if there were more like our mother and Brandmother.

## EARLY DAYS By Angela (Laverty) Kruzberger

For my Mum and Dad, Lilly and John Laverty. Things were very hard, with not much money and very little

profit to be made from working on the farm. I remember a sow gave birth to her piglets in a deep water hole and all were drowned. The hares came and ate all the seed after it was planted for

the cattle. The dingoes used to attack the cattle. Dad weent

but armed with a gun, cartridges and a screw driver. The

screwdriver was used to remove spent cartridges. The day he shot one large dingo but not before he and his tate had killed two cows and two more had to be destroyed. Four others were found injured, and three of them died later. So out of the whole lot only one was left alive. That one was sold for #4/2/6..which was the earnings for four

months hard work. The weekly meat order was one pig's head and a shin bone which was made into brawn or soup..Try doing this in 1989. Like many others they managed to raise a large family of ten with very little money, but lots of love for us all to share. And I know that we would not change our Mum and Dad.

"Dear Carol, I recieved this in the post today, so thought I would send on to you, as Heather would like it to go in the book. Hope you are sorting it out without too much trouble. "I remember the times: Heather Smith (Kirkman) Evan was a great one for a cuppa. No matter who called they were always invited in for a cup of tea or two. He would say "The kettle is just about boiled". Poor Lizzy would be expected to find some wood (There was never any in the woodheap), make the fire, and boil the water for tea.

Evan meanwhile would be rolling another cigarette and

catching up on the news. The tea would arrive about half an hour later.

There was this old Irishman we were all scared of. He rode a big grey horse and always smoked 0.P's tobacco. Well, whenever he approached the girls had this code. Some would start singing "Abe, Abe, Abe my boy". That was our cue to disappear and leave Lizzy to answer the knock or call. It took her a long time to work out why no-one else was ever about when he called. Poor old Lizzy got caught every time. The same gentleman went to mass at Taylors Arm and would put #1.00.00 on the plate. After Mass he would go and ask Father Colhan for some change. This is a true story." Love Noreen

## "Remember the time" By Margaret (Laverty) Sharpe

When any of our family get together all we do is "remember the time...". So even though it might not seem funny to anyone who hasn't been there and done that we could always find plenty to laugh at. Remember the time Mum was in Kempsey Hospital and dad.

decided he would make our Christmas pudding. He sent us kids

out to find as many raspberries and goosberries as we could

and he mixed this thing he called a pudding, tied it in a

bag, and cooked it in a kerosine tin. Well, it baked and

baked, and when he went to take it out it was jammed hard in the tin. She was a beauty. I can't remember if it tasted O.K. but with some of "Heather's" custard I reckon we would I have had a feast. Dad made us a bed mattress one time out of corn husks. We thought it was great until that night we discovered he had not taken the marbly bit out of the end. It wasn't real comfortable but what the heck, we loved it just because Dad

made it.

Our Mum was a wonderful woman. I've yet to meet another

mother who would have 19 babies in 20 years and never growl about it, but was overjoyed every time she was to have another "little one" as she would say. On October 1, 1955 our eldest daughter was born,..Evan and Lizzy's first Grandchild. Evan went all out and celebrated. They tell me he got drunk bought Mum a sewing Machine, a new set of saucepans and a new clothe's line. Isn't that just like a man...no flowers and chocolates in mind!

My brother, Kevin Laverty (now deceased) together with Peter Casey, John Walton, and Gary Larkey, used to play marbles throughout most of their lunch break. They would then race home for a sandwich and were always late for the bell. I found these definitions and I'm sure Kevin would have enjoyed them:

"COMMONOS"..Ordinary marbles used during games and for swaps.

"TAKERS"....Marbles given away when the game was lost.

"TOR".......Your favourite shooting marble

"BOTTLEDS"..Glass marbles from the neck of soda bottles

"CLAY DABS".White clay marbles.

"BONE ALLEYS" Marbles found in the frames of wall maps displayed in local banks. These were commonly "obtained" by children.

"AGATES"....Prized, colourful stone marbles. The most precious ward Cornelia which was said by some to be a form of gemstone.

"STEEL IES"..Metal marbles that came from the wheel bearings in the front wheels of the Ford.

I guess that every Laverty worth the name remembers the day. that Denny, while working in the bush, was caught in a heavy shower of rain. Being quite a cold day, he sought shelter in a hollow log which was quite warm and comfortable. In fact he became so relaxed that he fell asleep. The rain kept falling, and on awakening some time later Denny discovered that the log had considerably shrunk and he could move neither foreward nor back to get out. Thinking it might be possible that he would NEVER get out, thoughts of his past life floated before him as he tried VAINLY to think of a few worthy deeds or commendable actions he had performed in his lifetime. After a great deal of thought he finally remembered the day he had given a shilling ot the Salvation Army. At this thought he felt so small that he was able to slip out quite easily!

His wife's two cousins from Sydney, in their twenties at the time, were so engrossed by this tale, that after many Oos and Ahas they were almost ready to kill him when he got to the end of the story. Nevertheless, they were always anxious to hear more of Denny's. talse the bush. Eileen's favourite story was of the time he was sitting on

the grassy slope or rock playing his violin. Sensing some

slight movement behind him he cautiously took a sideways

glance, saw a snake approaching, kept on playing and....on the last note bought the bow back, let go smartly and killed the snake! It went out on a musical note) Then there was the time when Leo was living in Nowra that he and Denny decided to ride their pushbikes down Cambewarra Mountain, towing behind them some large tree branches to act as brakes. This is an extremely steep mountain and they came hurtling down at about a hundred miles an hour. The trip was not one they were anxious to repeat..

## Kathleen (Frew) Wormald.

We lived three miles from Burrapine hall and my Dad carted cream thirteen miles in a horse and cart. When my brother and I started school we stayed with our grandparents through the week and Dad picked us up to go home for the week-end. We used to drive a horse and buggy to the dances in Burrapine Hall and driving past the trees we always thought the moon was following us. There we slept upon corn husk mattresses in the hall. They were covered with striped material and rattled when you moved. In those days they danced till daylight when the children would be raused and we would go home. I remember well the 1921 flood when we lived on corned beef and home made bread.

## Michael James Laverty

Michael James Laverty, known as "Long Mick", was born on the nineteenth of August, 1899. He married Ada Daley of Kempsey on 1/7/1925.. He was born at "Riverview", Taylors Arm. The original house is still standing at the

back of the house presently owned by Mr M. Wright at Laverty's Bridge. On the property in the early years of the 1900's professional foot running was conducted. The newer part of the house stands on the track. Dad told the tale of the runner who slowed to run second, asked his reason he replied that the first prize was

a violin, one of which he already a new pipe which he could well do oned, but the second was with.

Mick was also a very good swimmer. The local races were held in the "Big Hole" almost behind the Taylors Arm Hall The local dances were also held at the barn at

"Riverview" in the early days.

Also on this property was the blacksmith's shop on the eastern side of the Taylors Arm Hall. Jack Laverty, Dad's father, and his Uncle Sam, had some memorable times here with other colourful characters of the area. Usually it was Sam's job to run the cutter to the Hotel for a "bucket of beer".

Our father never ventured far to claim a bride, she came to Taylors Arm, from Kempsey, to work in the local store. The Irish were certainly loyal. At this time, three Michael Laverty's lived at Taylors Arm. To save confusion they were referred to as "Long Mick"; "Mick"; and Michael. Dad did a bit of this, that, and anything, being a farmer; butcher and hire car operator amongst other things.

However, he managed to rear us during the Great Depression of the 1930's. He never had any Diplomas for Animal Husbandry however,

we can remember his attempt to circumvent a rogue bull he owned. The uoll kept breaking the fences to run with the herd. However, the cows needed to be regulated. His method was to use a corn bag undercarriage with a surcingle over the back to prevent penetration. This falled when he ran out of bags! The whole process proved a disaster and

de regulated the entire herd. The old homestead has changed ownership several times since we were there, however, we shall always remember the green, green grass of home". Written on behalf of the family by

Ronald. J. Laverty. 21/6/89.

## VINCENT JOHN LAVERTY. 1901-1974 By NOEL LAVERTY

In his early days he was a keen motor bike rider. Laverty's Flat in those days was full of corrugations, and to get over these ruts he used to travel at 80 m.p.h. on his Harley Davison, quite a fast speed in those days. His early working days consisted of scrub falling and grass seed picking by hand into tubs.

For sport he used to play cricket. Wood chopping was also a favourite sport and he was still doing this at the age of 60.

In the Depression years Vin and Ollie had a boarding house in Macksville. Board was 2/- a night per head and 2/6 for a three course meal. Everyday somebody would knock on the backdoor for a free meal because there was no work

available. After abo ut six years, Vin and Ollie sold out, went back to Taylors Arm and started a butcher shop. He used to kill all his own meats and cure his own bacon. Pigs had to be done in a special way, by using "box" timber logs. Bacon was

smoked over an open fire. Killing beasts for the shop had to be done in late evening during summer because of blow flies and no refrigeration. At dusk the dingoes could smell the blood, and would come to the slaughter house to eat it. One night, the dingoes were so bad they attacked the cattle. Vin had to get the shot gun out to them and shot his own dog by mistake.

Vin's mustering horse was called after an aboriginal bearing the name of "Gunnywildie". At show time he was entered into several ring events and won on many occasions. After selling the Butcher shop, Vin owned a banana plantation, and finished his working days working the farm with his brother "Long Mick". Those who knew Vin Laverty, say he didn't mind a "beer", or "a fight".

## "BUB" LAVERTY By Bernice (Laverty) Adams

This is about my Dad. Everyone knew him as "Bub" Laverty. Dad was born and lived a lot of his life in Macksville and Taylors Arm. He came from a big family: five boys; and five girls.

Dad could always tell some good yarns about when he was growing up in Macksville. Taking watermelons from the shop and eating them down by the river, collecting bottles by the pub, swimming in the old river baths, fishing and playing football were all part of the stories.

I wish he had written some of these incidents down for us. and our children. Dad was a jack of all trades and could do anything for any of his family. He had many qualifications in his life viz: banana grower, butcher, wool classer, the navy during

the war, and best of all.. a great Dad! He always called Taylors Arm home no matter where we were. Dad had a great love for all his family and was always

there for them.

I think that must go with the name "Laverty" as so many are warm and caring people.

## EARLY HISTORY OF THE LAVERTY FAMILY By Jane E. Laverty. 1988.

On July 22, 1841, John and Jane Laverty bid a final farewell to their families and set sail aboard the TRINIDAD from Greenock, Scotland. They were about to begin a new life as assisted free settlers in the colony of New South Wales.

Little over a month had passed since the twenty four year

old carpenter, John, had taken the 20 year old housemaid

Jane Mckaughan, as his bride.

They were both native of the village Bushmills in the County of Antrim, Ireland and had been educated to read and write. This would help them pass the time on the TRINIDADand later in the education of their children in isolated rural Australia.

Although the TRINIDAD was essentially a supply transport to the colony, 20 crew members, together with 164 emigrants paying one pound each, and carrying with them the specified 16 shirts; & pairs of stockings; 2 pairs of shoes and 2 complete suits of external clothing as men; or 6 shifts; 2 flannel peticoats; 6 pairs of stockings; 2 pairs of shoes and 2 gowns for women, undertook the 15 week, 2 day journey from Greenock to Port Jackson.

The trip was relatively trouble free under the mastership of James Brown. With only one death, that of an infant who was buried at sea, John and Jane and the other emmigrants turned Lheir minds to their future. It was rumoured that the land beyond the mountains was being

opened up and that it was rich and fertile. It was here that

the young couple planned to make their home.

Un November 6, 1842, the TRINIDAD dropped anchor at Port Jackson.

soon after arrival John Laver by applied for a land grant South West of Sydney. He recieved a grant of 40 acres on the Fluis River adjoining the road from Taralga to the developing township of Binda. At the time it was considered that 40 acres was sufficient for the raising of a family. It had been in the U.K.

Jane was by now showing the first signs of pregnancy. Her young lusband took to clearing and building on the new block. of land. They moved into the slab hut and on August 16, 1842, the first daughter, Isabella Ellen Laverty was born.

several other hard working celtic families now occupied blocks of land in the area which soon became known as Limerich. Many of them had similar backgrounds to John and June or were Licket-of-leave men. They included the Allport, Berrell, Cartwright, Croker, Mckenzie, McDonald, and Treacy families all of whom have descendants remaining in the Limerick-Laggan area Today.

---

By 1847 Jane had produced 3 more children, Ellen, Mary and Betsy. They did not dream that in 20 years tragedy was to strike with the deaths of Betsy and Ellen within four months of each other.

John and Jane's first son, John, was born in 1850, and was later to marry Mary Croker. In 1851 John and Jane were granted 30 acres for the sum of 30 Pounds. It was here on the Cooksvale Creek that they were to erect the substantial stone house "Hazeldean". This was to be built in the style of the houses he remembered from Ireland in the 1820"s. It had a shingle roof and a home-made brick oven. The kitchen was separate from the rest of the house as was the tradition.

for fire safety. John also built a supply store to service himself and his neighbours. It was built of Baltic Pine from the ballast of sailing ships imported to Australia. The store still stands today and Hazeldean is still owned and occupied by Lavertys. As time passed both John's land and family expanded. Between the years 1851 and 1862 six more children were born. They were Stuart, who married Kate Ritchie; Rose, who married Shadlow and was a housemaid to Banjo Patterson; James Boyd, who married Christina McDonald; Margaret; Robert, who married Jane Mc Donald, and Charles who married Alice Coupland.

John could never have envisaged that 140 years after he

first undertook the daunting task of clearing his block of scrub, that his descendants would be as avidly engaged in Reafforestation. John's son Charles was a surveyor and mapped much of the Limerick district in the 1880's before leaving the area to

work in Bridgetown, Western Australia, and helped in the opening up of that area. The other four sons remained in the Limerick area, farming.

Jane Laverty died in 1879 at the age of 59, and John four years later at the age of 66. Although neither lived to be particularly old, few could argue that their lives had been unfulfilled.

By the time of John's death he had seen the birth of eleven children, and four Grandchildren. The descendants of this couple, down to the sixth generation, still occupy and graze the land in the Limerick-Laggan area of N.S.W.

Anecdotes by Ian Laverty. Limerick 1989.

Researching ones family tree is an interesting and rewarding pastime. Time spent talking with aged relatives can produce gems of information and anecdotes revealing the humour of past generations, and our changing values.

I like this one.

UNCLE: My Great-Grand Father had five children.

NIECE: No uncle, he had eleven. UNCLE: Five

NEICE: No, Eleven

UNCLE: Well, the others must have been girls!

John Laverty and Jane Mc Kaughan were parents to the

children listed below:

ISABELLA (16/8/1842...19/12/24)

ELLEN (16/10/1843..24/10/1867)

MARY (8/7/1846....date unknown)

BETTY (22/5/1847...2/2/1868)

JOHN (8/2/1850....20/4/27)

STUART (18/9/1851...25/4/17)

ROSE (4/4/1853....date unknown)

JAMES (6/1/1856.... 19/4/12)

MARGARET (12/9/1857...date unknown)

ROBERT (16/8/1859... 11/6/0BX

CHARLES (4/2/1862.... 18/12/30)

JOHN LAVERTY (1850-1927)

John married Mary Croker whose parents had travelled on the TRINIDAD with John's own parents. Their only child Allan,. served with the 7th light horse in World War 1. Allan died on 29 February, 1917, shortly after his return to Limerick. After Allan's death John moved from "Kangaloolah", to Goulburn, but. maintained a benevolent interest in his nephews advising them on farming matters. He had been a hard working man and it is said he used his wife's bathtub in which to dip the sheep. He was also a firm businessman and threatened to pull a house down around some non-paying tennants in Goulburn. He had unharnessed the buggy and hitched the team to the chimney before the payment was forthcoming.

STEWART LAVERTY (1851-1917)

Stewart married Kate Ritchie. They produced no children, but raised Stewart's nephew Lance Laverty as their own. They lived at Hazeldean Limerick.

Stewart was noted, as were other Laverty's for his dry wit. He was a non-athletic gentleman who operated his farm and the Limerick store which had been established by his father. Stewart kept boiled lollies in an open jar on the counter, and as he went to the back store rooms for other goods the local children would pilfer them. He never seemed to notice, but he kept tobacco and the like well out of reach. Stewart's block needed some ring-barking and he being of short, stout stature, often dealt with this task on horseback. Some stumps are still visible, ringbarked seven, or eight feet above the ground. A disturbed possom once frightened the pony which bucked Stewart off. Unperturbed, Stewart remarked before painfully re-mounting "While I'm on the ground I might as well relieve myself!"

Like all sheep farmers, Stewart jealously quarded the health

of his sheep. One day when shearing was due to commence Long

Blows rode up on his horse with shears prominently displayed on the saddle. "Where are you going, Long?", Stewart asked "To shear for you" was the reply. "By cripes, you're not" retarted Stewart "You killed half of them last year. Do you want to kill the rest now?" Stewart had great bitterness of the Germans and Turks and took it with him to the grave. A clause in his will reads that his property is never to fall into the hands of Germans. or Turks or their descendants.

JAMES BOYD LAVERTY (1856-1912)

James married Christina McDonald and they made their home at Phils River, two miles upstream from their parents original slab hut. They produced nine children.. five sons and four daughters. James was a God fearing man. A regular Church goer, he often. rode the four miles downstream with the Anglican parson on. his way from Binda to the Bolong Church. Not wishing to: waste an afternoon he would take his dog along to inspect. sheep and shepherds on the return journey. On one occassion

the dog disgraced himself in the church. Pastor Heatherington said "I'm glad to see you James, but next month, leave the dog at home!"

ROBERT ALEXANDER LAVERTY (1859-1908)

Robert married Jane McIntosh and together they had nine.

children. Their first home was established at Deep Creek, mile from Hazeldean, but when it failed to rain Deep Creek dried up. Robert then built a second house, this time on a site high above Cooksvale Creek. Again, however, it proved. to be a long way from permanent water. This homestead "Fairview" is still occupied by their descendants. Robert and Jane's grandson became the second Allan Laverty: to lose his life due to war service. Allan, son of Adeline and Oswald Laverty, died when an unmarked Japanese prisoner of war ship was torpedoed by the Americans off the coast of the Phillipines on 12, April 1944. He was aged 28 years. Another Grandson, Leo McDonald was awarded the Military Medal for Bravery on the Kokoda Trail in 1942.

---

CHARLES LAVERTY (1862-1930)

Charles married Alice Coupland and they had three children. Charles was the only son of John and Jane to take up an occupation other than farming. He gained his surveyors ticket and surveyed land around Goulburn before moving to Western Australia when that state was being open up in the late 1880"s. They travelled by coach to Adelaide then sailing ship to Fremantle. Their infant son Lance was too frail and young to make the long journey. He remained in the care of his Ubcle Stewart and Aunt Kate.

Lance was later to own, in partnership with Charlie Hall, one of the first motor garages in Crookwell. In his declilning years he worked for Weekly's Stock and Station Agency in Crookwell. Lance married but left no children. Charle's daughters both lived in Western Australia. Charles is buried in Bridgetown Cemetery, Western Australia.

## Laverty's of Limerick By Jane Laverty

The information for the Laverty"s of Limerick has been primarily collected and supplied by Jane Laverty who is at present studying Biomedical Science at the University of Technology in Sydney. The two poems here printed are written by her.

### A SPECIAL PLACE.

Above the gold acacia

And sparkling rivers deep. Where Lowries spread their glorious wing. There lioes the place I seek.

A place so surely hidden Beneath the mountain pines

Casurina, yellow box, teatrees

Stockwhips and kelpie whines.

Where untamed hearts run rampant "till the setting of the sun Unfounded and unhampered

"till eighteen forty anr.

Now a land of sheep and cattle Of rolling hills and plains.

and a never cearing loyalty

Despite Drought, fire and flooding rains.

Named for a town in Ireland A village so far away

But in the Limerick of Australia That's where my dreams shall stay.

There lies my secret Eden

My birthplace and my home To there my soul shall wander

To there my soul shall roam.

1985.

### ODE TO CHARLES

The raging tongue of an Irishman

And the handsome knees of a Scott, You'll pick him from the mob of sheep

For he's smarter than the lot

"I'll be a bushranger like my Dad" he said, "And make a fortune of it.

I'll rule the land of Limerick town,

In the way that I see fit."

He's a smart young fellow, or so they say,

And might raise a quid or two,

With his loyal and faithful motorbike, And his trusty sheepdog Sue.

He's good with a gun, that's a well known fact, And people respect him for it. For that Irish streak's been known to flare,

And Lord knows what he could hit.

He loves the land on which he lives.

And no-one's game to shift him.

He's not quite mad, but not quite sane

For that's the Laverty in him.

Box 9 Nhill 3418.

To the Co-ordinators of the laverty Re-union. It has taken me some time to contact various relatives and get their replies. I am very grateful to Mrs Jean England of Bordertown S.A. who sent me the Algie family book. Also Mrs Betty Dart of Nhill and Nell and Max Etherton of Rainbow. We only know that Henry Laverty came from

Ireland, but nothing about his family. Henry and Jean (Algie) came overland from Edithburgh with a bullock wagon and took land at Yanac, which is 38 km north-west of Nhill. They had five daugnters and two sons. I cannot find any information about the daughter Alice. Several of the children were married at Yanac or Broughton. Both Henry and Jean are buried at Dahwedarre cemetery Yanac

also their son James and his wife Maude... I have sent photocopies of your information to some of the relatives as although there are many descendants of Henry and Jean, only my Father-in-law, Husband, and brother-in-law (and our children) now bear the family name. Also there is Robert Laverty of Coberg. He has no children. Hope this information is of some use to you

Yours sincerely Margaret Laverty.

Henry Laverty was born on Janurary 12, 1840 in Ireland. He married Jean Algie, in the Clare district some time before 1970. Jean was born at Pollockshaws, Scotland on March 14, 1846. They must have moved to Edithburg- probably onto the Algie farm as his name appears in a Rechobite Register as a member in Edithberg. Some time after 1876 they moved to Victoria where they took up a farm at Yanac near Nhill, and there lived the rest of their lives. Many descendants of the Laverty family still farm or live in the Nhill district. The children of Jean and Henry were:

MARY JANE (7/2/1870)

JANET MATILDA (25/4/1874)

ADA MARGARET (11/5/1876)

JAMES ERNEST (1881)

CLYDE WILLIAM (1882)
