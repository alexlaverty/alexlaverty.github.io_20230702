Hundreds of descendants of the Laverty

family flocked back to the Nambucca Valley recently for a family reunion. It was one of the many events held in the Nambucca Valley during the October long

weekend.

The family, which has traced its roots back to landing in Australia from Ireland and England in about 1860, filled the Macksville Showground hall to overflow ing for the occasion.

The hall was decorated with Bambo ferns and hundreds of balloons fishing. nets. Old and new photographs adorning the walls. A photograph of the first house built at

Taylors Arm- by a Laverty-took pride of place on the stage. About 1000 Lavertys (including their wives and husbands) took part in the reunion, including one family group with 200 descendants.

They danced into the small hours to the music of Phillip Laverty and Gavin Kings' "True Blue" band.

The dancing finished at lam, and some were back at 6.30am to decorate the truck for Open Air Mass on Sunday morning.
