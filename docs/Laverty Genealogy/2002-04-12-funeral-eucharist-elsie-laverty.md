## GATHERING SONG

"Come As You Are"

LI

Firs

Come as you are, that's how I want you Come as you are, feel quite at home.

Close to my heart loved and forgiven

Come as you are why stand alone?

No need to fear love sets no limits

Don't run away shame and disheartened

No need to fear love never ends. Rest in my love trust me again.

I came to call sinners not just the virtuous I came to bring peace not to condemn Each time you fail to live by my promise Why do you think I'd love you the less?

Come as you are that's how I love you; Come as you are, trust me again

Nothing can change the love that I bear you, All will be well, just come as you are.

## PRAYER OF THE ASSEMBLY

Creator God, you are the loving one who gave Elsie life by breathing into her your own divine breath. You are the all wise one who has now called her from among us.

We ask that in your wisdom and compassion you keep vigil with us as we learn to let go of this one whom we have greatly loved. May this time of tears and grieving be tempered by our story telling and mutual support. so that as we become strong together we may be ready to return our sister to you, our loving God.

We stand here with Jesus, the one who has shown us the true meaning of death. With him and in his Holy Spirit we place ourselves in your hands, now and forever. Amen.

Come to the water! You who are thirsty!

Though you have nothing, I bid you come!

And be filled with the goodness I have to offer!

Come! Listen! Live!

Listen to My word and you will enjoy:

Goodness and peace in your heart!

Just as the heavens are high above earth; My ways and thoughts beyond you! Call me your Father and know lam nearl I will be Father to you!

Just as the rain falls to water the earth; Just as a seed becomes bread... My word upon you can never return Until My longing is filled!

The love I have for you, my Lord, Is only a shadow of your love for me; Only a shadow of your love for me, Your deep abiding love.

My own belief in you, my Lord, Is only a shadow of your faith in me; Only a shadow of your faith in me, Your deep and lasting faith.

My life is in your hands,

My life is in your hands. My love for you will grow, my God; Your light in me will shine.

The dream I have today, my Lord Is only a shadow of your dream for me; Only a shadow of all that will be If I but follow you.

The joy I feel today, my Lord, Is only a shadow of your joy for me; Only a shadow of your joy for me When we meet face to face.

Lord, you give us life in this sacrament. May Elsie who received life at your table enter into the everlasting peace and joy of Christ your Son, who is Lord for ever and ever. Amen.

## FINAL COMMENDATION AND FAREWELL

Come to her aid, O saints of God, come, meet her, angels of the Lord. Receive her soul, O holy ones, present her now to God Most High.

May Christ, who called you, take you home; may you rejoice with Abraham. I know that my redeemer lives who, at the end, will stand with mel

Give her eternal rest, O Lord, may light unendin shine her. Receive her soul, O holy ones, present her now to God Most High.

Concluding Prayers

## PROCESSION FROM THE CHURCH

"In the Company of Angels"

## GRAVESIDE PRAYER

We bring the body of our sister Elsie Pearl Laverty to return it to the earth from which it was formed by our loving Creator. It is fitting that we do so, since it is this mother earth which gave her body shape and colour and strength.

We know that this is a worthy resting place. With reverence we touch this earth and bless our sister's body.

## WHEN THE CASKET IS PLACED AT THE GRAVE

Whilst we entrust this body of flesh to the earth from whence it came we remember the earth's faithful promise of spring - that from her dark and mysterious richness new and surprising growth abound.

This promise has been made clear for us in the resurrection of Jesus Christ, who, like Elsie, died and was laid in the earth. We believe, that like Jesus, our sister will come to new life in that same Jesus Christ. While we leave this holy place behind we carry with us the living spirit of Elsie and all those holy men and women who have gone before us and who now live a new and glorious life.

Commending their remains to this earth we commend their spirit to all who have loved and now remember them.....

## CONCLUDING PRAYER

Loving and merciful God hear the prayers we offer for our sister Elsie. By her faith and hope she has always been united with you, her Creator. By her generous nature she has been a loving disciple of Jesus Christ. In her strong and enabling love she has lived in your Holy Spirit.

Receive her now into the fulness of your presence. Give comfort to all of us who mourn her passing from our midst. For we believe that you will raise us all on the last day.

The Laverty Family thank you for your presence here today. We appreciate your prayers, support and friendship, and invite you to refreshments after this celebration at

Grafton City Services Bowling Club, Kemp Street (Opposite the family home).
