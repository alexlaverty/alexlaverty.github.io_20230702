Is your name Laverty, or perhaps Lafferty or O'Laverty.

We are having a Family reunion at Macksville Showground, on Saturday 30th September and Sunday October 1st.

All you long lost cousins are invited to turn up. Dance to the local bands on Saturday night, after fun and games all day, Sunday morning there will be Open Air Mass, hopefully for about 1,000 Lavertys and their relations.

Our ancestors arrived here in the middle 1800, form Down, Downpatrick, Limerick in Ireland and first settled on the Macleay at Pola Creek, then selected land at Taylors Arm, Bowraville and later at

Macksville. Quite a few families still live on the land at Taylors Arm, and a large number at Macksville.

The Laverty name is well known on the Nambucca Valley. Our families married into the Chapman, Walton, Reibel, Cassin, Lynch, McGree, Foster, Clarke, Fuller, Rowe, McPherson, Ballard, Donnelly, Welsh, Hudson, just a few in our area.

Food and drink will be available on both days, so hopefully it will be a great week-end and in years to come, we can start a conversation, with "Remember our week-end at Macksville".

For fourther information contact Dot Clarke (065) 68-1061 or Noreen Fuller (065) 64-7291.
