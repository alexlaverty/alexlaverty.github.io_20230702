Planning begins for McGree photo presentation

The mysterious saga of a photograph taken during World War One has almost reached its heart-warming finale.

Current custodians of the photograph, Melbourne resident David Sandground and Michael Long of England, have spent the past year tracking down its rightful owners - the McGree family of Taylors Arm. And now it is finally coming back to our shores.

Taylors Arm RSL Sub-Branch President Barry Fuller has spoken with David about involving the official presentation of the photograph to the McGree family in the unveiling of the new Taylors Arm cenotaph plaque around September or October.

A small mention of the famous Pub with no Beer was all it took for David to agree, and he is now try ing to get Michael to travel from England to attend the unveiling and presentation.

Taylors Arm's small but hardworking sub-branch are now in the process of up-dating the cenotaph with names of those who served in World War One and Two, and also more recent conflicts.

Following are the names gathered from honour rolls at Taylors Arm and Burrapine halls. Please con tact Barry on 6564 2206 if you know of any names which should be listed.
