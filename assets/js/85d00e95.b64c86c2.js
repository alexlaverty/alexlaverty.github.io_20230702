The community would be situated right next to the ocean, allowing residents to indulge in activities such as diving for seafood and surfing for exercise. The abundance of fresh seafood would make for delicious and healthy meals, and the surfing would provide a fun way to stay active and enjoy the beautiful natural surroundings."),(0,r.kt)("p",null,"In addition to the ocean-based activities, the community would also have a strong focus on technology and sustainability. One example of this would be a computer-automated hydroponic vegetable growing system. Hydroponics is a method of growing plants without soil, instead using nutrient-rich water to nourish the plants. A computer system would control the amount of water and nutrients provided to the plants, ensuring optimal growth and harvest. This would not only provide fresh, healthy produce for the community, but also reduce the environmental impact of traditional agriculture."),(0,r.kt)("p",null,"The community would also incorporate green energy into its infrastructure.
